Welcome to WCEC Mission Ministry!


WCEC is pleased to partner with many of Mission Organizations and Individuals
to expand the Kingdom of God through evangelism. We have a Mission Committee of
6-10 members, of whom are pastors, deacons, and faithful brothers/sisters, that
meet bimonthly or as needed to plan, review and discuss all mission activities
including mission support. Mission support budget is made during Oct to Dec for
the following year. Starting from 2015, each mission organization and
individuals that is currently supported or is seeking support from WCEC Mission
Fund is required to fill the Mission Support Request Form (see the link below).
All current supported units should also have received a letter from Mission
Committee (see the link below).


A new email account has been set up as mission.wcec@gmail.com for all mission
related communications. Please send any questions to this new email address.


Thank you for the opportunities to partner with you for the glory of our Lord,
Jesus Christ!
