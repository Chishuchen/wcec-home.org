non-Christan Chinese family. She first heard about Jesus from a Christian
Elementary school and later received Jesus as her Savior and was baptized as a
young teenager. God put a vision in her heart to serve the Lord full time in
the future, so after High School graduation she pursued her education at a

Community Evangelical Church on June 1, 2014. She received his Master of
Divinity (M.Div) degree from South East Asia Bible Seminary in 1995. God called
her to the Mission Field after graduating. She served overseas for 3 years
(1997-2000) where she met her future husband, Karl.

 

They have 2 children: Melody and Josiah. After marriage she stayed home with
 the children till they started school, serving as a volunteer at various
 Churches.  God directed her back to full time ministry and opened the way to
 serve at Wilmington Community Evangelical Church in 2014. Her passion in
 ministry is mission, children and family life.

  

Her life verse is Philippians 1:21: ‘For to me, to live is Christ and to die
  is gain.”
